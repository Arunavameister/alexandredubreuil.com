# Top 10 most mixed tracks of 2018

This year marks a turn in my DJ set since I decided to stop mixing techno altogether (for now). I decided I'd only mix tekno for a while (mainly tribal tekno), since it's the style I prefer. I discovered a lot of crazy tracks this year, from Keja's B2 and TODO, to Crystal Distorion's latest hardcore brainfuck.

## List

Coming soon.
