## [Domain Object Oriented Validation (dOOv)](domain-object-oriented-validation-doov)

Fluent, stream-like API are great for writing type checked code, taking advantage of Java 8 functions and lambdas. What about creating your own fluent API to manipulate and validate your model? We created an framework called dOOv, for "Domain Object Oriented Validation", that generates a validation DSL from a domain model. This presentation will demonstrate the efficiency and expressiveness of dOOv to define validation constraints. The validation rules are represented as an abstract syntax tree, which makes it possible to visit the tree and show the rule in text format, markdown, or HTML. We will compare our solution to industry standards like Bean Validation. During the session, we will live code legacy business rule migration to dOOv.

## [Apache Spark for Java Developers](apache-spark-for-java-developers)

Apache Spark proposes a Java API as a first class citizen, but is it as powerful as the Scala API? Does it use every feature of the language, such as lambdas? Does it integrate properly with our unit test tooling and existing Java code base? We will dive into the Spark Java API through examples and live coding from our code base, by covering the basic usage and dependency management, unit testing with JUnit, launching from an IDE and integrating Spark code with our existing Java code base. Since Spark version 2.0, the unified DataFrame API makes Spark easier to use and faster to execute in Java, but there is still little documentation on specific use cases, and many syntax quirks make Scala code difficult to convert to Java. The slides and live coding will present the good, the bad and the ugly moments our Java development team encountered while using Spark.

## [Continuous Merge with git-octopus](continuous-merge-git-octopus)

This presentation tackles the subject of continuous delivery with tangible solutions, that covers code versioning, handling of multiple parallel developments and deployment of artifacts. The concept of "continuous merge", made possible by the open-source tool git-octopus developed at LesFurets.com, is the most important part of our continuous delivery process. Continuous merge is a process that emerged from 2 years of daily delivery and enables the early detection of merge problems between branches. It is therefore possible to push to production everyday without sacrificing quality and without adding a burden on our development process.

## [Code Review](code-review)

Overview of our code review process based on a `git flow` branching strategy that does not require any tool.

## [AI Music Generation](ai-music-generation)

Overview of some AI music generation tools. We'll talk about music generation in general, real world examples, wavenet for voice, magenta for music, AI theory and state of the art.

## [Git Version Control](git-gestion-version)

Master class about git and version control systems.

## [Ximista Live Video Generation from Sound](ximista-live-video-generation-from-sound)

Generating video from sound with touch designer during live concerts.
