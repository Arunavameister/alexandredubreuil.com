\cvexperiencetitle
{Java EE Consultant}
{January 2010 - August 2013}
{3.5 years}
{CGI France}
{Paris, France}

\begin{cvexperience}%
  \cvlang{Java EE} consultant on a large scale front office and back office
  Java application, efluid, in the energy business (20,000 classes, 3,000,000
  lines of code). Responsible for the functional documentation, technical
  documentation, development, unit testing, delivery and formation.

  \begin{cvexperiencedescription}%
    \item Development of algorithms targeted for the energy market, such as
      price optimisation and energy curve manipulation. The algorithms where
      required to handle large datasets (1,000+ curves, millions of points)
      efficiently, in terms of memory and CPU usage. The implementations were
      multi-threaded. Those algorithms play a central role in the data handling
      of the application.

    \item Development of a \cvlang{cron}-like Java scheduler to defer heavy
      computations to other machines. The scheduler is available thought the
      Java \cvlang{RMI} interface and multiple synchronized instances can be
      started on demand. The scheduler is a central component in all
      \emph{efluid} modules for deferred executions.

    \item Design and development of a full \cvlang{AJAX}, \cvlang{Javascript},
      \cvlang{jQuery} and \cvlang{jQPlot} curve visualisation component, for
      price and energy curves. The component is used extensively by traders and
      salesmen to visualise price and energy history, and apply algorithms or
      operations on them. The component handles large datasets gracefully, by
      optimising memory consumption.
    
    \item Responsible for the design and maintenance of parts of the CGI Java
      EE Framework, especially for the generic algorithms module, the
      \cvlang{Javascript} and \cvlang{jQuery} taglibs and the Java scheduler.
      Support for the IT and delivery team to plan and deliver new versions of
      the framework.

    \item Member of CGI internal committees, such as the \emph{Technical
      Committee}, which decides and advises on solutions to technical problems
      ; and the \emph{Continuous Integration Committee}, which designs the
      application build process with \cvlang{Hudson}, the version tree with
      \cvlang{git} and promotes quality indicators and metrics with
      \cvlang{Sonar}.

    \item Technical referent, trainer and course writer for the development
      team, on subjects like \emph{Java Good Practices}, \emph{Unit tests with
      JUnit}, \emph{Delivery Processes with Maven and git} and \emph{Javascript
      and jQuery}.

    \item Team support for \cvlang{Linux} subjects such as system
      administration and \cvlang{Bash} scripts.
